  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Our programme is led by <span class="highlight">Dr Samar Mahmood</span> (GP Partner, Hoyland Medical Practice) and <span class="highlight">Dr Ali Mahdi</span> (GP Registrar) â€” experienced physicians dedicated to medical education and professional development.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Dr Mahmood</span> has a specialist interest in teaching and training, and has played a key role in developing the skills of GP trainees, clinical pharmacists, advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs), and medical students. He is an Honorary Senior Clinical Lecturer with the University of Sheffield and also serves as an examiner for the PLAB 2 exam, bringing a deep understanding of the standards required to succeed in UK medical practice.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Dr Mahdi</span> has a strong interest in teaching, training, and practice development, and has contributed to the design and delivery of local teaching programmes within NHS trusts. He has worked as an OSCE examiner for final-year medical students at several UK universities, helping to ensure future doctors meet the highest clinical standards. Dr Mahdi has a particular passion for neurodiversity, advocating for inclusive healthcare and raising awareness through education. He is committed to supporting learners at all levels, offering mentorship, practical skills training, and guidance to help them thrive in both academic and clinical settings.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Hoyland Medical Practice</span> has a strong ethos of education, mentorship, and continuous learning, offering a supportive environment for both undergraduate students and postgraduate doctors in specialty training. We believe that hands-on experience with real patients, under the close supervision of practicing clinicians, is the most effective way to grow in confidence, improve clinical skills, and become the best doctor you can be.</p>
